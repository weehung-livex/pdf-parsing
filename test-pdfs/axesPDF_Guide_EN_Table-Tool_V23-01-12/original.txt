You can it also see this way: A complex table is a table with nested header cells. In nearly all 
cases you can divide the complex table into several simple tables. This usually takes up more 
space in your document, but improves the comprehensibility.

2  The Table Tool 
2.1 What is the Table Tool? 
With the TABlE TOOL you can select table cells, check them, add Scope attributes or Header 
IDs. In order to use it, the table already has to be tagged properly. 
If tags are missing in your document, you are not able to select table cells or use the table tool 
at all. 
2.2 How do you start the table tool? 
You find the button to start the TABlE TOOL in the ribbon tab:Viewer, in the toolgroup: Tools, 
button: Table: 
 
Figure 1: The tab VIEWER with the TABLE TOOL. 
2.3 Basic features 
2.3.1 Different types of table cells 
If you select table cells by using the TABlE TOOL, you can recognize the type of the cell based 
on 3 different marks: 
Type Marked with a Example 
Table Header Cell (TH) Violet frame  
Table Data Cell (TD) Green frame 
 
Empty Cell (TH or TD) Blue ring

2.3.2 Understanding the circle symbol 
If you select table cells, a circle symbol appears on the left side of the selected cells as well as 
on the left side of related cells, that could be associated with the selected cells as header cells. 
The indicator symbol (on the left side of selected cells) 
If there is no association between selected cells and header cells, the indicator symbol is 
empty. If selected cells are already associated with header cells, the number in the circle 
symbol indicates, how many header cells are associated. 
The task icon (on the left side of header cells, that could be associated to selected cells) 
The task icon indicates, with which header cells the selected cells could be associated with and 
if you could do this for a single header cell or a bunch of header cells. 
You can also use the task icon to de-associate header cells with selected cells by holding the 
ALT key. The circle of the task icon changes its colour to red. This indicates the de-associating 
mode. 
2.3.3 Recognize and check associated header cells 
Indicator Symbol Number of associated header cells 
 
0 
 
2 associated header cells 
 
Additionally, red lines indicate, with which header cells a selected cell is associated. 
2.3.4 Associate header cells 
In order to associate cells with header cells you can choose between two strategies: 
  The Table Tool in axesPDF® 
 
Copyright © 2023 axes4 GmbH  13 
1. Only select header cells and add the appropriate scope attribute in the context-sensitive 
ribbon tab: Properties. In the following example it is the scope: row.  
 
2. Only select data cells or nested header cells: the task icons with the symbols triple bar, 
single bar or star appear on the left side of header cells that can be associated with the 
selected cells.  
 
On mouse-over the task icon changes the colour to blue. According to the indicated symbol by 
clicking the task icon you can execute one of the following tasks: 
Task icon Symbol Function 
 
Triple Bar Direct association of all cells that are marked by 
this task icon, with all selected cells in a straight 
line –vertically if the bars are arranged vertically, 
or horizontally if the 3 bars are arranged 
horizontally.

Task icon Symbol Function 
 
Single bar Direct association of a single cell that is marked 
by this task icon, with all selected cells in a 
straight line –vertically if the bar is arranged 
vertically, or horizontally if the bar is arranged 
horizontally. 
 
STar Direct association of a single cell that is marked 
by this task icon, with all selected cells in a 
curved line. 
 
2.4 Shortcuts 
Shortcut Function 
ALT task icon changes its colour to red. You are 
now in the de-associating mode. 
STRG task icon with triple bar changes to single bar 
task icon with single bar changes to star 
 
2.5 Use the table tool efficiently 
2.5.1 Step 1: Pre-Check 
Check first if your table really ... 
■  is a data table 
■  is built logically 
■  has clear relations between header cells and data cells 
■  is understandable 
If all requirements are met, continue with step 2. If you have a layout table, linearize it. In all 
the other cases your table cannot be made accessible. 
  The Table Tool in axesPDF® 
 
Copyright © 2023 axes4 GmbH  15 
2.5.2 Step 2: Check if your table is tagged properly 
Check if your table is tagged properly: 
■  Are there still any table issues in the checking results of the automatic PDF/UA check? 
■  Are all header cells marked as TH? 
■  Are all data cells marked as TD? 
■  Are all empty cells marked with an appropriate tag (TD or TH)? 
■  Do all merged cells have the correct COLSPAN or ROWSPAN attributes? 
■  Are all rows marked as TR? 
Select all cells in the table and check the markup based on the coloured frames. 
If there are still header cells marked as TD, select only the related cells and change their 
structure type in the ribbon tab: Properties to TH. 
2.5.3 Step 3: Evaluate if you have a simple or a complex table 
Evaluate if every header in your table is valid for a complete column and/or a complete row. 
If yes 
Your table is a simple table.  
You can choose the simplified association based on scope attributes. (See step 4a: Associate 
header cells by using SCOPE attributes). The scope attribute determines if a header cell is valid 
for a column, a row or both. You can choose between: 
SCOPE attribute Header is valid for 
COLUMN Complete column 
ROW Complete row 
BOTH Complete column and complete row 
 
Time Saver 
Do not evaluate your table if it is a simple or a complex one. Just associate header cells by 
using IDs. If you work with the table tool in axesPDF® you are as fast as using Scope 
attributes. You can jump over step 3 and go straight to step 4b: Associate header cells by 
using IDs. 
 
If no 
Your table is a complex table. You have to associate header cells by using IDs. (See Step 4b: 
Associate header cells by using IDs).

2.5.4 Step 4a: Associate header cells by using Scope attributes 
Use the following check list for associating header cells by using scope attributes: 
1. Select all column headers 
2. Add the scope attribute column in the ribbon tab: Properties 
3. Select all row headers 
4. Add the scope attribute row in the ribbon tab: Properties 
5. Select all headers, that are valid for columns as well as for rows 
6. Add the scope attribute both in the ribbon tab: Properties 
2.5.5 Step 4b: Associate header cells by using IDs 
Use the following check list for associating header cells by using IDs: 
7. Evaluate the deepest level of header cells.1 
8. Select the associated data cells. You can select all these cells in one step. Associate these 
cells with the header cells by clicking the task icon triple bar on the left side of the first 
header cell with the deepest level. If there is only one header cell that you can associate 
the selected cells with, click the task icon single bar. You can do this at the same time 
vertically (for column headers) and horizontally (for row headers) 
9. Then select the header cells that you have associated with, and associate their headers by 
clicking the related task icon. 
10. Repeat step 3 until you have reached header level 1. You do not have to select these cells 
because there are no header cells with level 0. 
2.5.6 Step 5: Final check of associated header cells 
Finally check your associated cells. As a first step click on the button: Tag Selection. 
If you have associated the cells by using the scope attributes, select one row or column of TH 
cells. The associated cells are highlighted in red. 
If you have associated the cells by using Header IDs, select one or several TD cells. The 
associated cells are highlighted in green. If you have multi-level header cells, start at the 
deepest level. Only the directly associated header cells are highlighted and not all header cells. 
 
 
1 Related to header cells the deepest level is the level with the highest number. For example: header 
level 4 is deeper than header level 2.
